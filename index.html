        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
          This study aims to find out whether there are any changes taking place
          in the way people speak in Corby, in the context of increased
          migration to the area in recent years. Participants will be
          interviewed, usually in pairs and in a location in which they feel
          comfortable (e.g. their home) and their voices recorded. These
          recordings will then be transcribed (written out) and analysed by the
          research team. They will also be compared with some recordings from a
          study carried out 25 years ago, to see what, if anything, has changed
          in the local dialect.

        <h2>Who can take part and what does it involve?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We are looking for people of different ages and from different
            backgrounds to take part in this study. Anyone currently living in
            Corby is invited to take part. We are especially interested in
            hearing from you if:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your parents migrated to Corby from elsewhere in the UK (London,
              Scotland, Wales, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              You have Polish heritage (e.g. a parent or grandparent was born in
              Poland).
            </li>
            <li>
              ...but we are also interested in hearing from you if your family
              has lived in Corby for generations!
            </li>
          </ul>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What will happen to me if I take part?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you choose to take part, you will be interviewed in a location of
            your choosing, at a time that suits you. The interviewer will ask
            general questions about the local area and your experiences in
            Corby. You will also be asked to read out a list of words and/or a
            short passage.
          </li>
          <li>
            The interview and any tasks will be audio recorded then transcribed
            and analysed. If you need to take a break, the interview can be
            paused at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some personal data will be collected (name, age, etc.); more
            information on how this will be used will be provided to
            participants.
          </li>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Do I have to take part?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Taking part is entirely voluntary and you can change your mind at
            any time. Refusal or withdrawal will involve no penalty or loss, now
            or in the future.
          </li>
